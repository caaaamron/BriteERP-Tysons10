Tools We Need To Use
== ===================
Maven
TestNG
Page Object Model
Selenium

How our framework will be organized
=============
* Tests
	- Functional Tests
	- Smoke Tests
	- Regression Tests
* Utilities
	- PagesUtils
	- GeneralUtilities

Git/Github 
===========
1) I will push my code to the main repository

2) You guys will pull my code and begin automating your tests and created any utilities (page object models) that you need to work on your page

3) Once you finish a test push it back to the repository. DO NOT do all your test and then push all of them. Once you finish one test push it, 
so that way if there is an error in that one test you can fix it faster than trying to fix 10 test cases at once.

4) We must use all the tools that they have given us to use because it is a requirement

5) Also you need to create 3 smoke tests atleast that will test main functionalities if one of your previous tests that you made does that already 
include that in the smoke tests folder



HOW TO PULL AND PUSH IN GITHUB 
======================

When you have your intellij open, open the command line and type 

git clone <link I'm going to provie you with> and that will remotely bring the project to your intellij

To push changes:
Once you've made a change to it use the git as you did before go to command line and type git commit -m "Your message description"

PLEASE LET US KNOW ONCE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES
